-better to have a StorageMain interface (containing only loadTasks() and saveTasks())<br>
-create other classes to implement StorageMain<br>
-finalise on type of structures to store Tasks (ArrayList or LinkedList or create our own structure?) (can ArrayList do Undo?)<br>
-finalise type of storage file (plain text, json, xml, ser, ...)<br>
