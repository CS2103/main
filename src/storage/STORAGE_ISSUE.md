-better to have a StorageMain interface (containing only loadTasks() and saveTasks())<br>
-create other classes to implement StorageMain<br>
-finalise on type of structures to store Tasks (ArrayList or LinkedList or create our own structure?) (can ArrayList do Undo?)<br>
-finalise type of storage file (plain text, json, xml, ser, yaml, ...)<br>
--XML (Extensible Markup Language): general purpose, better when loading a whole document than a small struct, existing parser and tool libraries, useful when sharing info between different environments. Disadvatages: complex syntax, difficult to read --> difficult to debug<br?
--JSON (JavaScript Object Notation): existing libraries, human-readbable, better when loading a struct, serialize a data structure thatâ€™s not too text-heavy and all you want is for the receiver to get the same data structure with minimal effort<br>
