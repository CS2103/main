-better to have a StorageMain interface (containing only loadTasks() and saveTasks());
-create other classes to implement StorageMain
-finalise on type of structures to store Tasks (ArrayList or LinkedList or create our own structure?) (can ArrayList do Undo?)
-finalise type of storage file (plain text, json, xml, ser, ...)
